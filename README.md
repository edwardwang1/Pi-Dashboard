# Pi-Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to be run on Raspberry Pi 3. While the dashboard can be run standalone, it was built to interact with [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/), an open source voice assistant. To do so, the Mycroft skill: skill-dashboard must be installed. See the [Github repo](https://github.com/edwardwang1/skill-dashboard) for additional details. 

## Dependencies
Install the [Google Client Library](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python):

`pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`

Install [PyOWM](https://pyowm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

`pip install pyowm`

Install [Pyro4](https://pypi.org/project/Pyro4/):
